3.	Initialize the stack size, top index, and the stack itself.
4.	Call the push function as needed.
 
Program:

      int size=3,top=1;
      float stack[40];
      void push (float data)
      {
      if (top==size-1 )

Algorithm:
1.	Declare global variables for the queue, rear, front, and iteration.
2.	Define the display function to print the elements of the queue.
3.	Initialize the queue, rear, and front as needed.
4.	Call the display function and perform other queue operations as needed.
 
Program:

            int queue[50], rear, front,i; void display()
            {
            if(front==-1)
            {

EXP NO:3E  C FUNCTION TO DELETE ELEMENTS IN QUEUE USING ARRAY

Aim:

To create a function in C that deletes an element from a queue implemented using an array.

Algorithm:

1.	Check if the Queue is Empty
o	If the front pointer is -1, it means the queue is empty, and there are no elements to delete. Print a message indicating that the queue is empty.
2.	Delete the Front Element
o	If the queue is not empty, the element at the front index is deleted.
o	Increment the front pointer by 1 to remove the element and point to the next element in the queue.
3.	Check if the Queue Becomes Empty After Deletion:
o	After deletion, check if the front pointer has passed the rear pointer (front > rear). If this is true, reset both front and rear to -1, indicating that the queue is now empty.
4.	End the Function.



Program:

      int front, rear;
      void dequeue()
      {
          if(front==-1&&rear==-1)
          printf("Queue Underflow.");
          else if(front==rear)
          front=rear=-1;
          else{
              front=front+1;
          }
      }
